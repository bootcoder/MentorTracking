## Mentor Tracking

### Purpose

The goal of this application is to provide an easy to use interface for Mentor
scheduling. Providing a portal for Mentors to book slots while generating solid
data which is track-able by administration is key.

### MVP

MVP will be accomplished when a Mentor can signin and book a shift via the app on the appropriate calendar and that shift's hours can be shown in a report.

### Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this app shoot me an email and I will add you to the trello board. I'm hoping to get MVP off the ground on my own, then open it up to the Mentor team for further development.
